%% Text of abstract

The extensible $N$-dimensional Data Format (NDF) was designed and
developed in the late 1980s to provide a data model suitable for use
in a variety of astronomy data processing applications supported by
Starlink. This paper provides an overview of the historical drivers
for the development of NDF and the lessons learned from using the
format for many years in the Starlink software collection and in data
acquisition systems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Author list not finalised. Should invite PTW, PWD, NXG and RFWS and others.

There is a renewed interest in file format choices for astronomy
including discussions on the future of FITS (Thomas et al 2014) and
with some projects adopting HDF5 and investigating JPEG2000. The
Starlink project \citep{2000ASSL..250...93W,2002A&G....43a..25P},
which began in 1980 \citep{1982MmSAI..53...55T}, was interested in
using a single file format for all their data reduction software. The
shift from a FITS-based format to a hierarchical self-describing
format was driven by data reduction efficiency requirements and the
desire to reuse software. A file format without a corresponding data
model caused chaos and it took sometime until order could be restored
with the definition of the $N$-Dimensional Data Format (NDF).

When the Starlink Project was created it soon became apparent that a
unified file format should be adopted for all the Starlink
applications. FITS \citep{1979ipia.coll..445W,1981A&AS...44..363W} had
recently been developed and was adopted as a tape interchange
format. A file format was required that was explicitly optimized for
data reduction applications and the choice of format involved much
debate (reference to FITS adoption). The initial Starlink software
environment, known as the INTERIM environment, proposed the use of the
Bulk Data Frame \citep[BDF;][]{1980SPIE..264...70P,SUN4}. The BDF format
was heavily influenced by FITS and used a FITS header block with
standard FITS keywords. Whilst it had a flexible design a special
``IMAGE'' variant was standardised for astronomical images and
spectra.

A data reduction file format should be efficient when generating
intermediate files and be able to address and modify individual items.
Additionally, it is import to be able to copy individual
self-contained structures from one file to another. At the time FITS
was not capable of doing this and it was realised that the finalised
Starlink software environment would benefit from a more advanced file
format capable of addressing hierarchical structures
\citep{1981STARENT4}.


\section{Hierarchical Data System}

The Starlink Data System\footnote{from which the file extension of
  \texttt{.sdf}, for Starlink Data File, was chosen.} was first
proposed in 1981 and the first version was released in 1982 \citep[see
e.g.][]{1982QJRAS..23..485D,1991STARB...8....2L}. In 1983 the name was
changed to the Hierarchical Data System (HDS) to make the file format
benefits more explicit. It was originally written in the BLISS
programming language on a VAX/VMS system and later rewritten in C and
ported to Unix.  HDS was in common usage in 1986 although it was
hampered by the next generation Starlink Software Environment
\citep{1986BICDS..30...13L}.  There are many parallels between the
hierarchical way HDS stores data within files and the way that a
filing system organises the files themselves.

Some key features of the HDS design are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hierarchical organization of arbitrary structures, including the
  ability to store arrays of structures.
\item The hierarchy is self-describing and can be queried.
\item The ability to associates structures with an arbitrary data type.
\item The ability to delete, copy or rename structures within a file.
\item Automatic byte swapping whilst retaining the native byte order
  for output files.
\end{itemize}

An early description of the internal layout of an HDS file can be
found in \citet{SSN27a}.

More recently HDS has been extended to support 64-bit file offsets so
that larger files can be written\footnote{Support for individual data
  arrays with a 64-bit integer size is not yet possible.}, and also the
addition of a 64-bit integer data type \citep{P82_adassxxiii}.

\_REAL & r & 32-bit IEEE float \\
\_DOUBLE & d & 64-bit IEEE float \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\section{File Format without Data Model}

HDS files allowed people to arrange their data in the files however
they pleased and placed no constraints on the organization of the
structures or the semantic meaning of the content. This resulted in
serious interoperability issues when moving files between applications
that nominally could read HDS files. Within the Starlink ecosystem
there were at least three prominent attempts at providing a data model
to organize the chaos.

\end{verbatim}

\caption{Example IMAGE structure using the Wright-Giddings
  convention. The components are all at a single level without any hierarchy.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

An early proposal \citep[][but see also \citet{SGP38}]{WrightGiddings1983} introduced the
\texttt{IMAGE} organizational scheme. This Wright-Giddings design specified that
data should go into a \texttt{DATA\_ARRAY} item and there should also be
items for pre-computed data minimum and maximum, and also a value for
a array-specific blank value. Errors were represented as standard
deviations and stored in \texttt{DATA\_ERROR} and bad-pixel masks were
stored in \texttt{DATA\_QUALITY}. Software was provided to convert BDF
format files to HDS using this model \citep{SUN96} and the format became
reasonably popular because of its simplicity.

There were a number of shortcomings with the design, not the least of
which was that it did not make use of hierarchical structures. The
design was very flat and heavily influenced by FITS and BDF.

\subsection{Figaro DST}

The Figaro data reduction package
\citep{1988igbo.conf..448C,1993ASPC...52..219S} independently adopted
a hierarchical design based on HDS, influenced by early discussions on
NDF. This DST\footnote{The reason for the name has been lost in the
  mists of time but our best guess is that it stood for \emph{\textbf{D}ata
  \textbf{ST}ructures}.} format makes good use of structures and supported
standard deviations for errors. The main image/spectral data was
labeled \texttt{Z} and was of type \texttt{IMAGE}, and axis
information was stored in structures labeled \texttt{X} and
\texttt{Y}. The axis structures reused components from the
\texttt{IMAGE} structure although they were themselves given a type of
\texttt{AXIS}. FITS-style keyword/value pairs were encoded explicitly
in a structure of type \texttt{FITS} but using scalar components for
each header item. This design meant that FITS comments could not
easily be encoded. An example trace can be found in \ref{fig:dst}.

\subsection{Asterix}

{\color{red} My examples are from the early 1990s so I'm not sure how
  much of this influenced NDF or was influenced by NDF. Documents from
  the mid 1980s suggest that ASTERIX used an HDS file before NDF and
  were the first to adopt HISTORY.}

The \textsc{Asterix} X-Ray data reduction package \citep{SUN98,1992STARB...9....3S} used the HDS
format exclusively until the introduction of an abstract data access
interface \citep{1995ASPC...77..199A} which allowed for the use of HDS
and FITS format files. \textsc{Asterix} defined its
own data models and layered those on top of HDS. The \texttt{SPECTRA}
layout was closest to that found in NDF and an example is shown in
Fig.\ \ref{fig:asterix} with a trace from a file created in 1992. The
use of \texttt{HISTORY}, \texttt{AXIS} and \texttt{DATA\_ARRAY}
structures provides some similarity to NDF. {\color{red} What
  components did ASTERIX develop themselves?}

\section{\emph{N}-Dimensional Data Format}

There is text in SGP/38 that can probably be brought over verbatim.

Funnily enough this seems to be a data model and not a data format.

Interestingly \citet{1993ASPC...52..199B} talks of how useful NDF was in designing the
2dF data reduction system using object-oriented fortran with NDF as
the object backing store.

Not trying to be comprehensive covering all possible astronomy
data. Trying to be generically useful whilst providing an extension facility.

Earliest reference to NDF I have found is Starlink bulletin 1988,
number 2. \citep{1988STARB...2...11C}

Anatomy of an NDF file

Proper block diagram of the hierarchy for each structure type? That
was part of the ADASS poster that could not be squeezed into the ADASS
paper and it needs to be made explicit.

\subsection{Data Arrays}

Data, Variance, Quality

Quality labels.

\subsubsection{Data compression}

Short description of options \citep{2008ASPC..394..650C}

\subsection{Character Attributes}

Title, Label and units

\subsection{Axes and WCS}

First there was \texttt{AXIS} and then there was AST. \citep{1998ASPC..145...41W,2001ASPC..238..129B}

\subsection{History}

Structured with a supporting API.

\subsection{Extensions}

\texttt{MORE}

FITS headers as single character block.

\subsubsection{Provenance}

Technically an extension rather than part of NDF. Or talk in context
of history?

Describe how we store the provenance and how this evolved from ascii
format for performance reasons. We also have scaling difficulties.

\section{Data Acquisition}

UKIRT and JCMT. AAO?

\section{Lessons Learned}

Covered somewhat in ADASS paper so need some more content as this is
the justification for the existence of this paper.

Successes:

\begin{itemize}
\item demonstrated usability in many wavelength regimes
\item can round-trip to and from FITS \citep[see e.g.][]{1997STARB..19...14C}
\item Pragmatic adoption of FITS header structure did make the format
  more transparent with the downside being that libraries had to be
  used to parse the character array and keep up with changes to the
  FITS convention.
\item Addition of data compression, WCS objects and provenance has
  proven the flexibility of the early design.
\end{itemize}

Things to be improved upon:

\begin{itemize}
\item Quality array should support more than a byte mask
\item Tables are important
\item Flexible variance definitions. Covariance: See Meyerdierks 1991,
  Starlink Bulletin 8, 19
\item Be vigilant with too much complexity in extensions when reusing
  an NDF structure in an extension can simplify tool access.
\item Checksumming. The FITS DATASUM facility is very useful and NDF
  should support it. Ideally it should be possible to generate a
  reference checksum for a structure. It may be that this has to be
  done in conjunction with HDS.
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusions}

From its beginnings in the mid-1980s the NDF data model has been used
throughout the Starlink software collection within diverse
applications such as SMURF \citep{2013MNRAS.430.2545C}, CCDPACK, GAIA
and KAPPA. It has also been used as a raw data acquisition format at the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and the United Kingdom Infrared
Telescope (was it used at ING and AAO?) and available in that form
from the UKIRT and JCMT archives at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre
\citep{2008ASPC..394..450E,P01_adassxxiii}. The shift from arbitrary
use of hierarchical structures to a data model enforced by a library
and API is extremely important.

Mention HDX \citep{2003ASPC..295..221G}.

Consider reimplementing NDF on top of HDF5. \texttt{MORE} extension
requires that initially this is done by reimplementing HDS itself as a
layer on top of HDF5. Then all the Starlink software would still work
and even tools like \textsc{hdstrace}. Would allow for an easy way to
add table support to NDF.

The main impediment to further NDF take up is that it's in
Fortran. Rewriting NDF and ARY in C would take some effort.

%% Following citation commands can be used in the body text:
%%
%%  \citet{key}  ==>>  Jones et al. (1990)
%%  \citep{key}  ==>>  (Jones et al., 1990)
%%
%% Multiple citations as normal:
%% \citep{key1,key2}         ==>> (Jones et al., 1990; Smith, 1989)
%%                            or  (Jones et al., 1990, 1991)
%%                            or  (Jones et al., 1990a,b)
%% \cite{key} is the equivalent of \citet{key} in author-year mode
%%
%% Full author lists may be forced with \citet* or \citep*, e.g.
%%   \citep*{key}            ==>> (Jones, Baker, and Williams, 1990)
%%
%% Optional notes as:
%%   \citep[chap. 2]{key}    ==>> (Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)
%%   \citep[e.g.,][]{key}    ==>> (e.g., Jones et al., 1990)
%%   \citep[see][pg. 34]{key}==>> (see Jones et al., 1990, pg. 34)
%%  (Note: in standard LaTeX, only one note is allowed, after the ref.
%%   Here, one note is like the standard, two make pre- and post-notes.)
%%
%%   \citealt{key}          ==>> Jones et al. 1990
%%   \citealt*{key}         ==>> Jones, Baker, and Williams 1990
%%   \citealp{key}          ==>> Jones et al., 1990

%%   \citetext{priv. comm.} ==>> (priv. comm.)
%%   \citenum{key}          ==>> 11 [non-superscripted]
